/*
 * Module: GenerateTestUserSig
 *
 * Function: Used to generate UserSig for testing. UserSig is a security signature designed by Tencent Cloud for its cloud services.
 *           It is calculated based on SDKAppID, UserID, and EXPIRETIME using the HMAC-SHA256 encryption algorithm.
 *
 * Attention: Do not use the code below in your commercial application. This is because:
 *
 *            The code may be able to calculate UserSig correctly, but it is only for quick testing of the SDK’s basic features, not for commercial applications.
 *            SECRETKEY in client code can be easily decompiled and reversed, especially on web.
 *            Once your key is disclosed, attackers will be able to steal your Tencent Cloud traffic.
 *
 *            The correct method is to deploy the UserSig calculation code and encryption key on your project server so that your application can request from your server a UserSig that is calculated whenever one is needed.
 *            Given that it is more difficult to hack a server than a client application, server-end calculation can better protect your key.
